# fyyur-artists-and-venues

Wrapup project for the Udacity course on SQL and Data Modeling (part of the Full Stack Web Development nanodegree).

The Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Migrate modules are used to flesh out this exercise in backend implementation. The starter code already provides a lot, mostly what's needed is defining the database schema, providing the proper relationships and constraints, and interacting with the database from the app.
